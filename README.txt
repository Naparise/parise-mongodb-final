My final project for Database Systems and Big Data Processing (COMP SCI 451) at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Green Bay.

Required Software:
node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
mongodb (https://www.mongodb.com/)

Instructions:
To install the required packages, enter the node directory and run "npm install"
To start the application, run "node webapp.js"

A MongoDB database hosted across a replication set is required for this application to properly complete database transactions. For instructions on setting up the replication set, see README.md.

User ratings are provided on a 1 - 5 star scale.
Rating averages are rounded up or down at the quarter marks.
Examples:
An average of 3.24 would be rounded down to 3 stars, while an average of 3.25 would be rounded up to 3.5.
An average of 3.74 would be rounded down to 3.5 stars, and an average of 3.75 would be rounded up to 4.
